# Introduction to the Project

In harnessing the power of data, statistics educators have begun to develop curricula that situates data science and statistics as a tool for social justice. However, successfully implementing these curricula requires unique considerations for the management of the classroom learning environment. 

# ECOTS 2022

We hosted a breakout session at the 2022 Electronic Conference on Teaching Statistics in which we shared our experiences and 
[ECOTS 2022 Breakout Session](https://causeweb.org/cause/ecots/ecots22/program/breakout/12). 

Additional resources for our session can be found [here]().  

# Upcoming Paper in Preparation

We are currently working on a manuscript that will provide recommendations, activities, and additional resources for teachers. Stay tuned!
