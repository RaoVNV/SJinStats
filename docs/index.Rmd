# Introduction to the Project

In harnessing the power of data, statistics educators have begun to develop curricula that situates data science and statistics as a tool for social justice. However, successfully implementing these curricula requires unique considerations for the management of the classroom learning environment. 

# ECOTS 2022

We hosted a [Breakout Session](https://causeweb.org/cause/ecots/ecots22/program/breakout/12) at the 2022 Electronic Conference on Teaching Statistics in which we shared our experiences and recommendations in a Panel Question & Answer session. The title of the session was "Social Justice Is More Than Just Using Critical Contexts: Embedding Social Justice into Curricula". 

Additional resources for our session can be found here:

# Upcoming Paper in Preparation

We are currently working on a manuscript that will provide recommendations, activities, and additional resources for teachers. Stay tuned!
